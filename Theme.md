Theme Development: 

To modify the themes PHP and CSS:

For our theme we decided to go with the following:

colours: 
- #000000 black
- #FFFFFF white
- #478aC9 blue 

we chose these colour schemes because it appealed to younger teenage and adult audiences than a darker or more colourful colour scheme. 

layout: we decided that the main outcome for the website was to have the content centered in the page.

Header: controls and hold naivgation links to other pages amongst the website as well as features such as the logo. We needed the header so we could sperate 
the main bulk of the content such as the pages name and the links to the other pages containing more content.

Footer: contains the socail media integration links as well as a mini nav bar to let user navigate without having to go back to the top. We needed this so it 
would have a seperate line and commmand for people who are at the bottom of the page as well as the socials for the townsville jazz club so that users can
find and follow the townsville jazz club on social media.

Yet to include:

develop theme updates locally, then test and deploy them to your staging and live sites. This should include aspects such as project management, version control, testing and automation
make sure you talk about this in the deployment md file
how we use our staging site to test before pushing to the main site
include things such as how we manage everything eg moving files across and back ups as well as version control
